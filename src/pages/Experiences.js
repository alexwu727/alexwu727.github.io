            <h1>Experiences</h1>
            <p>This page contains education and work experiences. As I mentioned in About me, I graduated from Santa Clara University.
            </p>
            <p>I also have multiple intern experiences. Most of them focus on backend. I learned how to build a scalable server. For example, when I worked in Aiello, I refactored the server API with Java Vert.x which let us split the entire API instance into multiple instances. This can highly increase the availiblity and scalibility.</p>
            <p>Last section record the online cources I have taken and am taking. I am an active learner, I am curious and love to discover new things and technologies. Therefore, in addition to my studies, I also found many online courses to participate in and practice. Among them, game development is worth mentioning. Game development deeply attracts me, and I hope that one day I can develop interesting and attractive games.</p>
