## My Current Role at Antra

In my present role at Antra, I've significantly ramped up my technical toolkit. I've acquired practical experience in various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle, CI/CD pipeline setups using Jenkins, and the application of Java Spring Boot frameworks. Furthermore, I've gained exposure to data streaming via Apache Kafka, Docker container orchestration, and the utilization of several AWS cloud services.
