During my internship at Academia Sinica, I served as a software engineer intern focused on significantly enhancing the efficiency of data collection processes for research studies. Using technologies like OpenCV and Django, I automated questionnaire data entry and created a real-time experimental platform to advance the quality of our research.

## Automating Data Collection with OpenCV and Django

My main mission was to automate the laborious process of collecting data from handwritten questionnaires into a research database.

- **Questionnaire Recognition System**: 
  - Utilized OpenCV to split and detect individual questions and checkboxes on the questionnaire forms.
  - Developed a rule-based model that leveraged feature engineering techniques to accurately recognize subjects' selections.

By implementing these automated processes, we were able to dramatically reduce the time spent on data entry, thereby allowing us to focus more on data analysis and research insights.

## Real-Time Experimental Platform with Django and Firebase

We aimed to facilitate interactive research studies through a real-time, online experimental platform. This was particularly challenging but equally rewarding.

- **Game-Like Simulation Experiment**:
  - When a user takes an action in the simulation, the application records every detail of the interaction in our Firebase database.
  - Utilized Firebase's event listeners to trigger functions that calculate round results based on the actions taken.

By leveraging Firebase's real-time capabilities, we were able to not only record intricate details of each game interaction but also to compute and store the results for each round automatically. This feature significantly improved the researchers' ability to design complex, interactive experiments while ensuring that all data was meticulously recorded and easily accessible for analysis.

### Conclusion

Questionnaire Recognition System culminated in a staggering 90% reduction in operating costs related to data collection. This operational efficiency allowed us to allocate more resources towards more complex research projects.

And the Real-Time Experimental Platform was a game-changer for our research team. It enabled us to conduct more interactive experiments, which led to more insightful results. It also helped us save time and resources by automating the data collection process.
