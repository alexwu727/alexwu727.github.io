## Navigating the Technical Landscape

Though my expertise initially gravitated towards backend development, my scope has expanded over time. I've delved deep into creating scalable servers, architecting efficient API gateways, and mastering the fundamentals of load balancing and caching. My professional journey also enriched my DevOps experience, particularly in Docker and containerization technologies.

## On Becoming a Full-Stack Engineer

While my work has primarily been in backend development, where I've gained experience with Java Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, and etc, I recognize the importance of being well-rounded in today's tech landscape. That's why I've set my sights on mastering frontend technologies as well. 

I'm actively learning the basics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get a strong foundation. But I'm not stopping there. I'm also diving into popular frameworks like React to give myself a competitive edge. 

The goal is to become a Full-Stack Engineer. This would not only make me more versatile but would also allow me to see projects through from start to finish. I'm excited about the doors this will open in terms of career opportunities and the kinds of projects I'll be able to tackle.
