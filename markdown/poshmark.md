At Poshmark, I was part of an innovative team focused on maintaining and upgrading the company's core infrastructure. This journey was filled with challenges, skill-building, and successful outcomes. Below are some project highlights that demonstrate my technical skills and ability to collaborate in a fast-paced environment.

## Migrating from Trinidad to Puma

One of the landmark initiatives I was deeply involved in was the migration from an outdated Trinidad server to Puma. Trinidad had served its purpose, but with the last update being seven years ago, it was hindering our progress. When the team was contemplating solutions, I conducted extensive research and found that Puma was our best bet. 

- **Selection Criteria for Puma**: 
  - Active community support
  - Robustness and speed
  - Compatibility with our existing tech stack
  
- **My Contributions**: 
  - Researched and evaluated different server options before settling on Puma
  - Migrated existing configurations to ensure a smooth transition
  - Integrated a new logging feature to monitor server health
  - Implemented the server deployment on our Docker cluster
  - Conducted performance tests, comparing key metrics before and after the transition

- **Outcome**: 
  - The switch to Puma led to a 20% increase in server response times and reduced downtime, enhancing user experience.

### Additional Technical Contributions

Beyond the server migration, I had an expansive role that involved me in various additional projects:

- **Logging System**: Understanding the importance of actionable insights, I took the initiative to build a thorough logging system using Apache Log4j2. This wasn't just for data collection; it was an advanced setup that allowed for detailed tracking, thus enabling us to make data-driven decisions for future improvements.

- **Load Testing**: Ensuring a server's reliability isn't a one-time task. To keep our new Puma server up to speed, I used Locust to conduct performance tests on servers with different environment variables. This helped me fine-tune the server settings for optimal performance. To make this process even more efficient, I created Python plots to visualize the performance metrics and wrote Shell scripts to automate the whole process.

- **Collaboration with DevOps**: I worked closely with our DevOps team to containerize the Puma server, making it more portable and easier to manage. This involved drafting and executing various configurations to optimize the server for our specific needs. It was a vital part of our migration strategy, ensuring smooth deployment and operational efficiency.

### The Personal Growth Aspect

Working at Poshmark also gave me something invaluable: the chance to grow as a communicator and leader. 

- **Presentation Skills**: One of the highlights of my time there was when I presented my work at an all-hands meeting. This was more than just a technical briefing; it was my moment to articulate the impact of our team's efforts, helping me hone my communication skills.

- **Soft Skills**: Apart from technical proficiency, the experience also helped me recognize the importance of team collaboration, problem-solving, and effective communication in achieving professional goals.

### Conclusion

To sum it up, my tenure at Poshmark was more than just a job. It was a period of significant professional development and personal growth. I had the chance to work on meaningful projects that improved the company's technological landscape and, in the process, grew both as a tech professional and as an individual.
