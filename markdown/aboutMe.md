# Welcome!

I'm Alex Wu and I work as a Software Engineer. I'm from Taiwan but now I live and work in Santa Clara. I am currently working for a company called Antra, where we focus on tech consulting.

## The Spark That Lit the Flame

My tech journey has an unconventional beginning. While in a college department focused on business analysis, I discovered the allure of programming through Python crawlers and machine learning models. This piqued my interest in the foundational aspects of computer systems, from data protocols to operating system architecture. Such curiosity led me to transition into a more specialized educational track, earning a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Santa Clara University.

## Navigating the Technical Landscape

Though my expertise initially gravitated towards backend development, my scope has expanded over time. I've delved deep into creating scalable servers, architecting efficient API gateways, and mastering the fundamentals of load balancing and caching. My professional journey also enriched my DevOps experience, particularly in Docker and containerization technologies.

## On Becoming a Full-Stack Engineer

While my work has primarily been in backend development, where I've gained experience with Java Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, and etc, I recognize the importance of being well-rounded in today's tech landscape. That's why I've set my sights on mastering frontend technologies as well. 

I'm actively learning the basics like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get a strong foundation. But I'm not stopping there. I'm also diving into popular frameworks like React to give myself a competitive edge. 

The goal is to become a Full-Stack Engineer. This would not only make me more versatile but would also allow me to see projects through from start to finish. I'm excited about the doors this will open in terms of career opportunities and the kinds of projects I'll be able to tackle.



## My Current Role at Antra

In my present role at Antra, I've significantly ramped up my technical toolkit. I've acquired practical experience in various stages of the Software Development Life Cycle, CI/CD pipeline setups using Jenkins, and the application of Java Spring Boot frameworks. Furthermore, I've gained exposure to data streaming via Apache Kafka, Docker container orchestration, and the utilization of several AWS cloud services.

## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I have other ways to enjoy myself. Basketball has always been a big part of my life. Though I'm no expert, I love the game and the camaraderie it brings when I play with friends.

Another passion of mine is exploring national parks. The tranquility and natural beauty these parks offer are truly refreshing. I've set myself a goal to visit all the national parks eventually, taking in the unique sights and experiences each one has to offer.

After a long day, nothing beats kicking back with some good comedy shows. Favorites like 'The Big Bang Theory' and 'Brooklyn 99' are my go-to picks for a hearty laugh. I even have a small dream of taking acting classes in the future. It's something that's been on my mind, and who knows, maybe I'll give it a try someday.
