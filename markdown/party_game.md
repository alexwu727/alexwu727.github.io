Recently, I had the unique chance to blend my development skills with my personal life by designing a series of party games for the Chinese New Year celebration. The format involved grouping players into teams to compete in a series of five challenges, with the highest-scoring team earning a prize at the end.

### Game Management with React
To facilitate this, I developed a website using React, which served as the hub for various game mechanics like audio playback, question generation, and real-time display.

### Utilizing APIs for Unique Challenges
One unique game involved players guessing a song based on its lyrics spoken by Google Translate. To implement this, I used an API to fetch the corresponding MP3 files for playback.

### Final Thoughts
Merging my technical expertise with personal interests was both challenging and rewarding. This experience has further solidified my appreciation for the versatility and potential of my skillset. I look forward to undertaking more projects like this in the future.
