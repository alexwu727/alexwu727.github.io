I'm Alex Wu and I work as a Software Engineer. I'm from Taiwan but now I live and work in Santa Clara. I am currently working for a company called Antra, where we focus on tech consulting.

## The Spark That Lit the Flame

My tech journey has an unconventional beginning. While in a college department focused on business analysis, I discovered the allure of programming through Python crawlers and machine learning models. This piqued my interest in the foundational aspects of computer systems, from data protocols to operating system architecture. Such curiosity led me to transition into a more specialized educational track, earning a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Santa Clara University.
