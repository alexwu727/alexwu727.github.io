## Beyond the Screen

When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I have other ways to enjoy myself. Basketball has always been a big part of my life. Though I'm no expert, I love the game and the camaraderie it brings when I play with friends.

Another passion of mine is exploring national parks. The tranquility and natural beauty these parks offer are truly refreshing. I've set myself a goal to visit all the national parks eventually, taking in the unique sights and experiences each one has to offer.

After a long day, nothing beats kicking back with some good comedy shows. Favorites like 'The Big Bang Theory' and 'Brooklyn 99' are my go-to picks for a hearty laugh. I even have a small dream of taking acting classes in the future. It's something that's been on my mind, and who knows, maybe I'll give it a try someday.
