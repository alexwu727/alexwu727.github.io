The planet Tetra is inhabited by TetRovers. TetRovers are generally peaceable people who love to explore and see \u201cwhat is out there\u201d in the universe. Therefore, TetRovers value \u201cStarMaps\u201d which contain many secrets to the distant galaxies in the universe and were written a long time ago by their ancestors.","Some of TetRovers, called TetHeroes, are specially trained to study and protect the StarMaps from falling into evil hands (TetVaders). TetVaders are TetRovers who have ambitions to take over the universe and have chosen evil ways to do so. TetVaders are always on the lookout for StarMaps since they will help them to find the worlds out there for them to conquer.","So on Tetra, when our story unfolds, there is just one TetraVader who lives in VaderBase, a number of (at least two) TetHeroes who have HeroBase, their home- bases, a few TetRovers (at least two) and a number of StarMaps in a number of locations.","More details about this simulation are in the github repo.","We used 6 design patterns listed below.","Prototype: While TetHero is in the Vader base. He/She restores the map and clones one save it in his/her base. Add an abstract function \u201cclone(): MapClass\u201d and a prototype constructor \u201cMapClass(MapClass map)\u201d in the abstract parent class MapClass. In this way, we can create clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.","Singleton: In our scope, there is one and only Tetra surface. Use singleton pattern to make sure that the Tetra surface has only a single instance and has a global access point to this instance.","Factory: We use a inhabitant factory to create inhabitant on Tetra star. There is an abstract creator \u201cInhabitant\u201d and three concrete creators \u201cTetRover\u201d, \u201cTetHero\u201d, and \u201cTetVader\u201d. These creators create the product \u201cBase\u201d. There is an abstract function \u201ccreateBase(): Base\u201d in the abstract creator \u201cInhabitant\u201d. In concrete creators \u201cTetHero\u201d and \u201cTetVader\u201d, they create \u201cHeroBase\u201d and \u201cVaderBase\u201d and put them on the Tetra surface.","Template: In the abstract parent class \u201cInhabitant\u201d, the function \u201cwalk()\u201d is built by multiple steps. It contains two abstract methods which are implemented in its children \u201cTetRover\u201d, \u201cTetHero\u201d, and \u201cTetVader\u201d. We can let subclasses override only certain parts of a large algorithm, making them less affected by changes that happen to other parts of the algorithm.","Facade: We separate our application into two parts: frontend and backend. Create a facade \u201cBackendConsole\u201d which contains all functions the frontend needs. The frontend uses this facade instead of calling the subsystem objects directly.","Command: Use Command interface as a middle layer and concrete commands to reduces coupling. Instead of send the request directly by buttons to BackendConsole, store separate request details with method to trigger requests into two concrete command buttons to link to."]},{id:"6",name:"Stores Backend",date:"Dec 2022",image:"images/flask.webp",description:"This is a RESTful API built with Flask, designed for a store system's backend.",tech:"Python, Flask, Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis",url:"https://github.com/alexwu727/flaskApp",paragraphs:["In this project, I built a RESTful API using Python and Flask. I utilized Docker to containerize the application, and utilized PostgreSQL as the database. I also integrated user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

The game is designed for two players, who take turns flipping cards in order to match pairs and earn points. One of the key features of our game is the use of OOP concepts, such as inheritance and encapsulation. We have implemented three classes: Player, Card, and Board. The Player class manages the players' scores and turn-taking, the Card class handles the individual card functionality, and the Board class manages the game board and the overall flow of the game. By utilizing OOP, we were able to create a structured and organized codebase, which made it easier to add new features and debug any issues. The game also allows for easy modification and expansion in the future. Our team is proud of the final outcome of the game and it has been a great learning experience for us to apply the knowledge of OOP in this project.","Additionally, our game features a graphical user interface (GUI) that was created using the Qt framework. The GUI allows players to interact with the game through a visually pleasing and intuitive interface. It includes features such as buttons for flipping cards and displaying the players' scores, as well as the game board itself. By using Qt to create the GUI, we were able to take advantage of its powerful and versatile set of widgets and layout management tools. This made it easy for us to create a polished and professional-looking interface, and to ensure that it was responsive and user-friendly.","Overall, the combination of C++ for the game logic and Qt for the GUI allowed us to create a complete and well-rounded project that successfully incorporates OOP concepts and provides an enjoyable user experience."]},{id:"4",name:"IQ Booster",date:"Dec 2021",image:"images/androidStudio.png",description:"IQ Booster is a knowledge sharing app using Android Studio.",tech:"Java, Android Studio, Firebase",url:"https://github.com/zawinglee/IQBooster",paragraphs:["IQ Booster is a mobile app that aims to provide users with a platform for sharing and acquiring new knowledge.

The system consisted of two main parts: the client and the server. The client would send packets to the server, and the server would acknowledge the receipt of each packet with ACKs.","One of the challenges I faced was implementing error handling mechanisms for the system. For example, if the ACK timer expires and the ACK from the server has not been received by the client, an error message should be displayed on the screen. Additionally, the server would also need to handle various types of errors such as out-of-sequence packets, length mismatch errors, missing end of packet identifier errors, and duplicate packets.","Another aspect of the project was creating a client-side software module that acts on behalf of a cell phone. The module would send a request for identification to the server, which would then verify the validity of the request by checking a Verification_Database. The contents of this file would be saved on the server and contains the subscriber's number, technology, and payment status.","Overall, this project allowed me to gain experience in creating a customized protocol on top of UDP and implementing error handling mechanisms.

It is not well-maintained, the last release is about 7 years ago. This may cause the server is not compatible while new tech comes in. Thus, to increase the reliability, we found that Puma is suitable in our situation. It is simple and fast. Most importantly, it has been updated lately and its community is active these days. My task is refactoring our JRuby application. I started Puma server, immigrate the configurations, implement log features, deploy to the docker cluster, and run the performance test at the end. The server works well and the performance is 20% faster than the previous one.","Migrated application server from JRuby to Puma: By migrating the outdated JRuby server to Puma, I was able to improve the stability and reliability of the company's application server. This involved updating the server configurations, testing the new server and ensuring that all of the existing applications were compatible with the new server.","Implemented logging feature: To improve the visibility into the application server's performance, I implemented a logging feature using Apache Log4j2. This included configuring various log levels and implementing a deflator to reduce the amount of data stored in the logs.","Developed an automated load testing framework: To ensure that the new application server could handle high traffic loads, I developed an automated load testing framework using Locust. This framework was able to simulate millions of simultaneous users and was distributed across multiple virtual machines.","Created performance plots: To monitor the performance of the new application server, I created performance plots using Python and Shell script. This allowed me to track key metrics such as response time and throughput, and make adjustments as necessary to optimize performance.","In addition to these technical contributions, I also had the opportunity to showcase my work during an all-hands meeting.

This abstraction helped to ensure consistency and ease of use across all API controllers.","Furthermore, I established a Vert.x instance to consume log data via Apache Kafka queue to analyze customer experience and enhance business strategy.

To accomplish this, I utilized OpenCV to split each question and checkbox, and then used a rule-based model, which is a part of questionnaire recognition system, to figure out which option the subject had chosen. The rule-based model was developed using feature engineering results to accurately detect check box selections and automate the collection of handwritten paperwork for user identification. The system was developed using Django as the server-side framework.","The result of this project was that we were able to save a significant amount of time while inputting data into the database for further research.
